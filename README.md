# CML
---
This is a library for tensors/ndarrays in c based on how numpy works in python.

## Purpose
I often find myself needing to use ndarrays in c and do not know of any good libraries that already exist.

## How to Use
For now, just copy the source files into your project dir, but later I will make it easier to use as a library.
